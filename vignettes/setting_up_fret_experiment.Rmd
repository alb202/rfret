This documentation explains how to set up a FRET titration experiment with
appropriate controls to get data readily usable by `rfret`.

# Material

- Donor-labeled macromolecule "D" of interest,
- acceptor-labeled macromolecule "A" of interest,
- unlabeled macromolecule D,
- unlabeled macromolecule A,
- binding buffer,
- 384-well black microplate.

# Assay setup

In the microplate, use three rows (possibly with technical replicates;
fluorescence values from such replicates will be averaged) to set up the
following titration series by serial dilution of the highest concentration of
titrant:

- donor correction experiment: serial dilution of unlabeled molecule A plus a
  constant concentration of donor-labeled molecule D,
- acceptor correction experiment: serial dilution of acceptor-labeled molecule A
  plus a constant concentration of unlabeled molecule D,
- interaction experiment: serial dilution of acceptor-labeled molecule A plus a
  constant concentration of donor-labeled molecule D.

# Data collection

Use a plate reader instrument to measure, in this order, the FRET channel, the
acceptor channel, and the donor channel fluorescence intensity. Excitation and
emission wavelengths, as well as bandwidths, should be optimized beforehand on
samples of labeled molecules.

The FRET channel is collected first to avoid bleaching the acceptor fluorophore
before the FRET measurement. The acceptor channel is collected second, because
exciting the donor will also excite the acceptor to a certain extent if there is
FRET happening.
